# Getting Started with Azure Storage in PowerShell

Demonstrates how to use the Azure Storage service in Azure PowerShell (v1.3.0).

> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and Classic](../articles/resource-manager-deployment-model.md).  This repo provides sample scripts for both models. However, Microsoft recommends ARM for most new deployments.

If you don't have a Microsoft Azure subscription you can

## Running this sample

1. Download and install [Azure PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9811175&clcid=0x409).
2. Start Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) in **Administrator Mode**
3. At this point, you can either:
  - Create a new script and copy and paste a script from this repo into the new file: Click File > New
  - Or download/clone this repo and open a script from this repo: Click File > Open
4. Provide the appropriate values for each variable (e.g. "Subscription Name", "Storage Account Name", etc.). Note: The angled brackets should not be included in the values you provide.
5. Run the script by pressing F5 or clicking the "Run Script" icon.
